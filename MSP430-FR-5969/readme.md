# MSP430-FR-5969
This code is for connecting the AD5941 Electrochemical Front End (EFE) provided by Analog Devices (AD) to the MSP430FR5969 microcontroller provided by Texas Instruments (TI).
The first project (adc) covers Open Circuit Potential (OCP) measurments through differential voltage measurements perfomed using the embedded 16-bit ADC and the input multiplexer.
The second project (amperometric) covers the amperometric measurement perfomed using the low bandwidth AFE loop (dual VDAC and trans-impedance amplifier).
