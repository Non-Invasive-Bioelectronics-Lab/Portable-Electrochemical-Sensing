<br />
Codes and tutorials for implementing low-cost and low-power portable impedance and electrochemical measurement systems.\
<br />
One prototype of this platform is used to interface novel electrochemical sweat sensors implemented on flexible substrates.\

<br />

Instructions are provided for implementing this electrochemical and impedance measurement platform using different processing and communication modules including:
* two ultra-low power microcontroller units (from the MSP430-FR family) provided by Texas Instruments (TI)
* two BLE-based units BL652 and BL654 provided by Laird; based on Nordic nRF52832 and nRF52840
