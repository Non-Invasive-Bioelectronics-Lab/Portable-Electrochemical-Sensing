# Portable-Electrochemical-Sensing
Codes and tutorials for implementing low-cost and low-power portable impedance and electrochemical measurement systems.
The MCU modules includedare two ultra-low power microcontroller modules from the MSP430-FR family provided by Texas Instruments (TI) and two BLE-based processing and communication modules 
provided by Laird; BL5652 and BL654 which are based on Nordic nRF52832 and nRF52840, respectively.
